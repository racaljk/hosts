# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.\n\
#\n\
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each\n\
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should\n\
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.\n\
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one\n\
# space.\n\
#\n\
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual\n\
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.\n\
#\n\
# For example:\n\
#\n\
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server\n\
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host\n\
\n\
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.\n\
#	127.0.0.1       localhost\n\
